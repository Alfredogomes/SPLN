00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,526
- I think they all do that.
- They all have that?

178
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,929
Anyway, we got two
U.S. attorneys in the house.

179
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:31,531
Big doings.
Your name keeps coming up.

180
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:33,565
Yeah? Hey, give me
a hand here, would you?

181
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,767
Just-- just a little bit there.
Thanks.

182
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:39,338
[Herzog]
I hired Peter Schuler in 1992.

183
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,974
Almost single-handedly,

184
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,976
he grew up a little
restaurant division

185
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,078
into an industry leader

186
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:50,514
and a source
of great personal pride.

187
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,251
I am shocked and saddened
by his death

188
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:59,590
and outraged by the damage his actions have
brought upon my grand-father's company.

189
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,726
[Speaks german]

190
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,127
Alleged actions.

191
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:07,264
An innocent man does not
kill himself.

192
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:10,200
My people and I
are here to help.

193
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,302
Through your investigation
I pledge Madrigal's

194
00:16:12,337 --> 00:16:15,138
full cooperation
and transparency.

195
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:19,642
I confess I have
my selfish reasons.

196
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:23,079
I believe Peter Schuler
was a lone anomaly.

197
00:16:23,113 --> 00:16:25,414
But if that is not the case,

198
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:26,916
I want to know it,

199
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,951
just as you do.

200
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:33,389
So when you gonna announce it?

201
00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:35,091
I don't know.

202
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:39,794
- As I'm walking out the door with my
big cardboard box.- You can't do that.

203
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:41,997
You know damn well we're
gonna throw you a big party.

204
00:16:42,031 --> 00:16:44,866
Damn straight.
We're talking a blowout.

205
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:53,307
Outstanding police work, Hank.

206
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:55,342
If only I'd listened.

207
00:16:56,577 --> 00:16:59,113
But I guess
the damage was done.

208
00:17:01,283 --> 00:17:03,750
It's not right,
them putting this on you.

209
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,111
Somebody's gonna go
under the bus.

210
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:11,558
Ramey's a good man.

211
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:14,160
He'll do right by you.

212
00:17:14,194 --> 00:17:18,431
Besides, this office
practically runs itself.

213
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:21,534
Bullshit it does.

214
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:23,101
Sir.

215
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:29,642
What's with that APD thing?
The electromagnets?

216
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:31,643
They're thinking
it's about Fring's laptop.

217
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:33,778
Turns out a couple of days
before it happened,

218
00:17:33,813 --> 00:17:36,681
desk sergeant gets this phone
call from a "postal inspector"--

219
00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:38,182
Quote, unquote--

220
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:40,117
Wanting to know
where they keep the thing.

221
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:42,987
And he told them?
Jesus.

222
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,989
Anything left of the laptop?

223
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:48,125
[Scoffs] Do we look that lucky?

224
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,362
You know, I sneaked a peek before
APD took it out of Fring's office.

225
00:17:51,396 --> 00:17:53,364
The whole thing was encrypted.

226
00:17:53,398 --> 00:17:55,833
They wouldn't have got
anything anyway, but...

227
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:01,572
So Hector Salamanca
killed Fring.

228
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:05,029
But who gave
Salamanca the bomb?

229
00:18:05,742 --> 00:18:07,377
Whole lot of questions

230
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:09,145
and not much
in the way of answers.

231
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,646
Yet.

232
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:14,784
The APD did find
some of Fring's financials.

233
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:17,439
That just might
lead to something.

234
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:23,825
I had him out to my house.

235
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,128
Fourth of July.

236
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:28,330
We cooked out in the backyard.

237
00:18:28,365 --> 00:18:30,065
My son shucked the corn.

238
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,834
My daughter cut up potatoes.

239
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:34,536
Fring brought sea bass.

240
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,304
Every time I grill it now,

241
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:39,840
I make a little foil pouch,
just like he showed me.

242
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,543
That whole night,
we were laughing,

243
00:18:42,577 --> 00:18:47,181
telling stories, drinking wine.

244
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:50,218
And he's somebody else
completely.

245
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:53,953
Right in front of me.

246
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:58,258
Right under my nose.

247
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:32,870
<i>Hi.</i>
<i>What can I get you?</i>

248
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:36,206
- Just tea, please. Chamomile.
- Oh, sorry, we don't have chamomile tea.

249
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,043
Then some sort of bergamot,
provided it's not Earl Grey.

250
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,977
I like soy milk
instead of dairy.

251
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:44,013
We don't have soy milk
or any sort of bergamot.

252
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:46,649
Wow. You're really running me
through my paces here.

253
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:48,151
Uh-huh.

254
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:50,486
Well, English breakfast,
I guess.

255
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,188
We have Lipton's.

256
00:19:52,222 --> 00:19:54,724
That's pretty much all we have.

257
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,727
I would like a cup of
hot water, filtered,

258
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:00,428
if possible,
ad a single slice of lemon.

259
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:02,430
And I'm assuming
you don't have stevia?

260
00:20:02,464 --> 00:20:06,068
Never mind.
I brought my own.

261
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:11,239
You coming to me,
or am I coming to you?

262
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:12,907
Face forward.

263
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:15,009
We'll talk like this.

264
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,679
I guess I'm coming to you.

265
00:20:19,815 --> 00:20:21,315
Ohh.

266
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:24,018
Mmm.

267
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:31,791
Take a breath, will you?

268
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:34,828
This place is safe,
no one's gonna see you here.

269
00:20:36,897 --> 00:20:38,231
My God!

270
00:20:38,265 --> 00:20:41,067
Duane, this is so--
Thank you.

271
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:43,169
How did I not see you
sitting back there?

272
00:20:43,204 --> 00:20:44,837
So weird.
[Chuckles]

273
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:46,705
You want anything else, Mike?

274
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,874
No.

275
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:51,977
I'm good, Fran.
Thanks.

276
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:56,915
[Sighs]

277
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,651
How about
we lose the sunglasses?

278
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:02,820
I feel like I'm talking
to Jackie Onassis here.

279
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:08,359
There you go.

280
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:12,663
Breathe in, breathe out.

281
00:21:12,697 --> 00:21:15,966
Drink your whatever.

282
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:27,343
Who killed Gus?

283
00:21:27,378 --> 00:21:29,946
Haven't I told you
not to worry about that?

284
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:34,549
Now, what do you want from me,
and why is it so important?

285
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,921
What's this?

286
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:40,756
A list of 11 names.

287
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,258
Okay.

288
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:44,626
You know them all.

289
00:21:46,462 --> 00:21:47,929
I do.

290
00:21:47,963 --> 00:21:50,598
Those 11 men-- and I think
you know this, Mike.

291
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:52,767
Those 11 could sink us,
you and me both.

292
00:21:52,802 --> 00:21:54,702
Where are we going
with this, Lydia?

293
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:57,305
No specific.
I'm just pointing out facts.

294
00:21:57,339 --> 00:21:59,407
These men-- your men--
yours and Gus's--

295
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:01,676
these men were on the payroll,
very publicly.

296
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,611
They trace back to Pollos
and the laundry.

297
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:05,946
They trace back to Madrigal, and they're
gonna get picked up by the police.

298
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,315
And when they do, when they get picked
up and threatened with prosecution,

299
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:10,517
and there's only one way out
for them, they're gonna--

300
00:22:10,551 --> 00:22:13,120
And I'm not saying
all of them. Okay?

301
00:22:13,154 --> 00:22:15,488
All it's gonna take is two
or three, or even one.

302
00:22:15,523 --> 00:22:17,490
But there's always
a weak link somewhere.

303
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:19,859
But they're gonna talk.
At least one of them's gonna talk about you,

304
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:22,328
about me, and that's all
it's gonna take.

305
00:22:22,362 --> 00:22:25,397
These are the 11 I know of,
but I'd love your input.

306
00:22:25,432 --> 00:22:27,766
I never met your chemist,
for instance.

307
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:30,502
I'd love your input.

308
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:37,075
You want me to kill
every man on that list?

309
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:39,845
Wow. That's a leap,

310
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:41,913
what you just, uh...

311
00:22:41,948 --> 00:22:44,282
No, I didn't say that.

312
00:22:45,384 --> 00:22:49,187
But if you think
that'd be wise...

313
00:22:50,189 --> 00:22:51,723
[Sighs]

314
00:22:51,757 --> 00:22:54,358
You're scared, aren't you?

315
00:22:54,392 --> 00:22:55,759
Yeah.

316
00:22:55,793 --> 00:22:57,761
You're very upset,

317
00:22:57,795 --> 00:23:00,064
which I'm gonna factor
into my response here.

318
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:05,769
These are my guys,
and they are solid.

319
00:23:05,803 --> 00:23:08,071
- Understand?
- What about Chow at the warehouse?

320
00:23:08,105 --> 00:23:10,273
Didn't one time you have
to shoot him through the hand?

321
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,342
You think that didn't
stick in his memory?

322
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:14,277
What about Dennis
at the laundry?

323
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:15,778
They're sure to pick him up.

324
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,348
They already have.
They picked him up last night.

325
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:21,817
My guys are solid.

326
00:23:21,852 --> 00:23:24,887
I vetted them with great care,

327
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:27,055
and Fring made sure
they were well compensated

328
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,324
in the event
of a situation such as this.

329
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,558
They're paid
to stand up to the heat,

330
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:35,229
keep their mouths shut,
no matter what.

331
00:23:35,264 --> 00:23:37,265
And they will.

332
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:41,468
Now, I don't know what kind
of movies you've been watching,

333
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,338
but here in the real world,
we don't kill 11 people

334
00:23:44,373 --> 00:23:46,873
as some kind of
prophylactic measure.

335
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:49,876
Look at me

336
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:52,412
and say you understand.

337
00:23:53,414 --> 00:23:55,315
I understand.

338
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:57,150
I get it.

339
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,319
So we're off
that very silly idea?

340
00:24:02,522 --> 00:24:04,023
Good.

341
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:15,167
Drink your hot water.

342
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:29,680
- I gotta go.
- Have you had enough?

343
00:24:29,714 --> 00:24:31,416
Yeah. I'm good.

344
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,583
Okay.

345
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:33,951
[Quietly]
Bye-bye.

346
00:24:33,985 --> 00:24:35,419
- Bye.
- Bye.

347
00:24:35,453 --> 00:24:37,187
Bye, big brother.
[Chuckles]

348
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:39,022
Say bye to mom for me.

349
00:24:40,724 --> 00:24:43,093
I will.
Have a good day.

350
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:44,995
You, too.

351
00:24:46,897 --> 00:24:48,731
[Door opens] [Sighs]

352
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:51,367
[Door closes]

353
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:01,110
[Quietly] - Skyler.
- Mmm...

354
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:02,445
Hey.

355
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:05,614
The car wash opens
in 15 minutes.

356
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:08,516
Mariano can open for me today.

357
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:15,923
Hey, how about you get up, huh?

358
00:25:19,328 --> 00:25:20,828
Come on.

359
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,998
A shower will feel good.

360
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,581
Hey, Chow.

361
00:25:44,551 --> 00:25:46,652
How you holding up?

362
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:48,754
Okay.

363
00:25:48,788 --> 00:25:51,224
You know,
they-- they--

364
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,192
They talked to me.

365
00:25:53,227 --> 00:25:55,860
You can't smoke in here, Chow.

366
00:26:16,348 --> 00:26:18,349
[Elevator bell dings] [Hank]
Thanks for coming down.

367
00:26:18,383 --> 00:26:21,352
Have a seat,
Mr. Ehrmantraut.

368
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:24,221
Am I, is that right?

369
00:26:24,256 --> 00:26:26,423
Close enough.

370
00:26:26,457 --> 00:26:29,825
So, once more, you're waiving your
right to have an attorney present?

371
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,327
Correct.

372
00:26:31,362 --> 00:26:33,430
Could you state that
to the camera, please?

373
00:26:33,464 --> 00:26:36,499
I'm waiving my right
to have an attorney present.

374
00:26:36,534 --> 00:26:40,002
Uh, okay, then.
We just have a few questions.

375
00:26:40,037 --> 00:26:43,439
You're currently employed
by the Pollos Hermanos chain.

376
00:26:43,473 --> 00:26:45,107
- Is that correct?
- Yes, I am.

377
00:26:45,141 --> 00:26:47,242
- And what do you do there?
- Corporate security.

378
00:26:47,277 --> 00:26:49,511
- Corporate security?
- Yeah.

379
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:53,248
What's that?
Like, uh, guarding the special sauce?

380
00:26:53,283 --> 00:26:55,951
I conduct employee
background checks,

381
00:26:55,985 --> 00:26:58,419
I oversee loss prevention.

382
00:26:58,454 --> 00:27:02,090
At a fast-food restaurant,
that's a full-time job?

383
00:27:02,124 --> 00:27:05,426
We have 14 locations.
So, yes, it's a full-time job.

384
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:07,095
Yeah, well...
[Chuckles]

385
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:09,830
If I were you, I'd start
sending out those resumes.

386
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:12,733
It says here you're
a private investigator?

387
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:14,367
Where you licensed?

388
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:16,136
New Mexico, Arizona, Utah.

389
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,837
Every state where we operate.

390
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:19,439
Colorado?

391
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:21,108
You have some restaurants
there, right?

392
00:27:21,142 --> 00:27:22,976
Colorado doesn't
require licensure.

393
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,844
You licensed
to carry a firearm?

394
00:27:24,878 --> 00:27:26,779
Concealed carry?
Yes, I am.

395
00:27:26,814 --> 00:27:28,315
Which states?

396
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:31,183
It'd be quicker to mention
the states in which I'm not.

397
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:33,185
And if we pulled your CCP's,

398
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,686
everything would be in order?

399
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:37,156
I'm guessing you've already
done that, so you tell me.

400
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:42,428
You strike me as a former cop.

401
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:43,962
Am I right?

402
00:27:46,086 --> 00:27:47,393
Where at?

403
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,536
Philadelphia.

404
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,605
Philly.
[Chuckles]

405
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:55,607
The city of brotherly love.

406
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:59,377
It turns out we, uh--
We know some folks there,

407
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,446
and they told us that your
tenure as a police officer

408
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,383
ended somewhat,
uh, dramatically?

409
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:08,318
You wanna talk about that?

410
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,886
Not particularly.

411
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,322
Yeah, me neither.

412
00:28:13,924 --> 00:28:15,992
See, I'm more interested
in why Gus Fring

413
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,128
decided to put a guy like you

414
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,363
in charge of
his corporate security.

415
00:28:20,397 --> 00:28:24,800
I mean,
given your... history

416
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:28,204
doing background checks
on pimple-faced fry cooks.

417
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:29,205
Seems like over...

418
00:28:30,174 --> 00:28:32,508
What else you do for Fring?

419
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:35,177
He must've needed help
running that drug empire

420
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:37,011
of his, no?

421
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:39,681
Drug empire?

422
00:28:39,715 --> 00:28:44,386
First I'm hearing about that.
I don't know anything about that.

423
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,189
Hey, man, we have a guy that could
put you in that underground lab,

424
00:28:47,223 --> 00:28:48,756
and he'll testify to it.

425
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:51,925
So from here on out,
this can go hard or easy,

426
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:54,495
so what's it gonna be?

427
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:06,739
Forget your handcuffs?

428
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:08,107
I'm confused.

429
00:29:08,141 --> 00:29:10,543
Am I under arrest here,
or am I not?

430
00:29:17,284 --> 00:29:19,619
You wanna state that
for the camera?

431
00:29:23,756 --> 00:29:28,026
You are not under arrest,
currently.

432
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,562
Agents, do you have
any more questions for me?

433
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:33,632
Because you've got me
very stirred up

434
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:35,967
with all these false accusations.

435
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:38,437
If I'm not under arrest,
I'd prefer to leave.

436
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:42,173
Uh-uh.

437
00:29:45,477 --> 00:29:48,980
And I suppose we could talk
about the two million dollars

438
00:29:49,014 --> 00:29:51,750
in your granddaughter's name.

439
00:29:54,886 --> 00:29:56,854
Yeah. It seems, uh,

440
00:29:56,888 --> 00:29:59,389
Fring had all these
secret offshore accounts

441
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,058
that he would
deposit money into--

442
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,726
Like, uh, well,
an even dozen of them--

443
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:04,194
And they're all in the names

444
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:05,729
of certain people
on his payroll.

445
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:08,899
There was the, uh--
The manager of the laundry,

446
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:12,969
um, a couple guys from
the Pollos distribution center.

447
00:30:13,003 --> 00:30:16,839
There was the owner of a chemical
warehouse, a bunch of others.

448
00:30:16,874 --> 00:30:20,609
You know, guys that must've been
getting paid off the books.

449
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:26,382
Anyway, one of the names
was Kaylee Ehrmantraut.

450
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:29,985
Ten years old

451
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:32,587
and just cute as a button.

452
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:34,756
Yeah.
Two million and change

453
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,892
we found on deposit for her.

454
00:30:36,926 --> 00:30:38,760
Way more than anybody else.

455
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,762
Now, my partner here,

456
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,097
he took one look at that
and said, "Shit, man.

457
00:30:43,131 --> 00:30:46,433
This fifth-grade girl is the muscle
behind Fring's entire operation."

458
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:49,003
I said, "Whoa, whoa.
Hey, partner, slow down there.

459
00:30:49,037 --> 00:30:51,038
Maybe it was actually

460
00:30:51,072 --> 00:30:54,008
her dear old granddaddy."

461
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:56,343
Impressive, no?

462
00:30:56,377 --> 00:30:58,078
But...
[Clicks tongue]

463
00:30:58,113 --> 00:30:59,779
Level of insight?

464
00:31:01,048 --> 00:31:03,183
He's not impressed, Gomie.

465
00:31:03,217 --> 00:31:06,920
Perhaps he's picturing
all that money going bye-bye.

466
00:31:06,954 --> 00:31:08,922
Yeah, well, I mean,

467
00:31:08,956 --> 00:31:13,026
the government's gonna take
every last dollar, unless...

468
00:31:15,028 --> 00:31:16,995
Well, here's the thing, Mike--
or Michael?

469
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,264
- Mr. Ehrmantraut.
- Here's the thing, Mike.

470
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:21,099
Lucky for you,
you didn't touch that money.

471
00:31:21,134 --> 00:31:24,269
I cannot say the same
for the other 11 on the list.

472
00:31:24,304 --> 00:31:26,504
One of your guys
is gonna roll on you,

473
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:29,007
and then we'll definitely
remember the handcuffs.

474
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:31,042
Now, before that day comes,

475
00:31:31,076 --> 00:31:33,978
you can do yourself a solid.

476
00:31:34,012 --> 00:31:36,948
You can tell us what you know,

477
00:31:36,982 --> 00:31:40,617
you can tell us
who's still out there,

478
00:31:40,652 --> 00:31:43,554
and if we like your story,

479
00:31:43,588 --> 00:31:45,556
good things can happen.

480
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,891
Kaylee might be able
to keep some of that money.

481
00:31:47,925 --> 00:31:50,293
Maybe.

482
00:31:50,328 --> 00:31:52,495
So what do you say?

483
00:31:57,034 --> 00:31:59,702
I don't know anything
about any money.

484
00:32:01,105 --> 00:32:03,672
I don't know
what you're talking about.

485
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,334
First order of business

486
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,503
is to find a new place to cook.

487
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:21,871
Before anyone says it,
no more RV's.

488
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,874
I don't know. The crystal
ship did pretty good for us.

489
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:26,677
The "crystal ship"?

490
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:32,316
- Yeah. That's what I called it. - Well,
I'll admit it held us on as a starter lab,

491
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,718
but it was too dark, too small,

492
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,720
not to mention
it could've broken down

493
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,221
at any moment.

494
00:32:38,255 --> 00:32:41,424
Saul, find us someplace
safe from prying eyes.

495
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,892
Security against detection
is paramount.

496
00:32:43,927 --> 00:32:45,561
But I don't
wanna drive too far.

497
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:48,664
No more 50-mile treks
to some Indian reservation.

498
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:50,165
In town is trickier.

499
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,668
I mean, you got a lot more
of your prying eyes.

500
00:32:52,703 --> 00:32:56,999
If Gus can manage it,
then so can we.

501
00:32:59,842 --> 00:33:02,677
Precursor.
Where are we with that?

502
00:33:04,113 --> 00:33:06,047
Uh, we're good on everything

503
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:09,683
except, uh, methylamine.

504
00:33:09,718 --> 00:33:11,385
No surprise.

505
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:13,387
It's just dry as hell out there.

506
00:33:13,421 --> 00:33:16,056
What if we switched back
to a pseudo cook?

507
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,891
Absolutely out of the question.

508
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:21,061
Jesse, there is methylamine out there.
I know it.

509
00:33:21,095 --> 00:33:22,730
Yeah, but what if there's not?

510
00:33:22,764 --> 00:33:26,399
Because there isn't.
I mean, really.

511
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:28,268
There is.

512
00:33:28,302 --> 00:33:31,070
Have faith.

513
00:33:31,104 --> 00:33:33,105
Can I--
Can I offer a thought?

514
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,440
Uh...

515
00:33:35,476 --> 00:33:37,610
Say a guy wins the lottery.

516
00:33:37,645 --> 00:33:39,545
Ten million bucks.

517
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,681
The very next day,
what's the one thing he does not do?

518
00:33:42,715 --> 00:33:45,350
He does not go buy another
lottery ticket, right?

519
00:33:45,385 --> 00:33:49,388
He counts his lucky stars, and
he sails off into the sunset,

520
00:33:49,422 --> 00:33:52,524
which, seems to me,
and all due respect,

521
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:55,894
some advice you two might take.

522
00:33:55,928 --> 00:33:59,263
What lottery did I win exactly?

523
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:00,931
Hey, you're alive.

524
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:03,901
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
that's the Irish sweepstakes.

525
00:34:03,935 --> 00:34:06,170
I'm alive, and I'm broke.

526
00:34:06,204 --> 00:34:08,172
Counting the money
that I owe Jesse,

527
00:34:08,206 --> 00:34:09,973
I'm about 40 grand in the hole.

528
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:11,809
Does that seem like
an acceptable

529
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:13,877
stopping point to you?

530
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:18,748
There is gold in the streets,

531
00:34:18,783 --> 00:34:24,154
just waiting for someone to come and
scoop it up. But, me? I should quit now.

532
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:26,623
Jesse, too, I suppose, huh?

533
00:34:26,657 --> 00:34:28,192
Wow.

534
00:34:28,226 --> 00:34:31,360
I got you this time, kid.

535
00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:34,030
And how come you get two,
and I only get one?

536
00:34:34,064 --> 00:34:36,833
Hmm?

537
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,500
Oh, no, you don't.

538
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,870
That one's mine!

539
00:34:40,904 --> 00:34:42,205
[Mutters]

540
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,174
No. Aaahhh!

[Phone buzzing] [Mutters]

542
00:34:51,314 --> 00:34:53,148
Oh.

[Buzzing continues]

544
00:34:54,984 --> 00:34:57,085
I give up, baby.

545
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,889
You're too good.

546
00:35:00,923 --> 00:35:01,922
[Beeps]

547
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:06,360
- Yeah?
<i>It's me, you got a minute?</i>

548
00:35:06,394 --> 00:35:08,996
<i>Yeah. A minute.</i>
<i>What's up, Chow?</i>

549
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,299
The DEA,
they call me to come back.

550
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:15,369
- Say they want to talk more.
<i>- I'm sure they do.</i>

551
00:35:15,403 --> 00:35:17,304
[Toy whirring]
Did you call your lawyer?

552
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:20,373
<i>Yeah, but, Mike,</i>
<i>the DEA take all my money.</i>

553
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:21,707
<i>I need it.</i>

554
00:35:21,742 --> 00:35:23,709
I need my money.

555
00:35:23,744 --> 00:35:25,711
You understand.

556
00:35:25,746 --> 00:35:28,314
<i>What do you want me</i>
<i>to do about it?</i>

557
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:30,149
I don't know.

558
00:35:30,184 --> 00:35:32,886
I don't know.
We gotta talk.

559
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,719
Not on the phone.

560
00:35:34,754 --> 00:35:36,855
<i>Can you come to my house?</i>

561
00:35:40,726 --> 00:35:42,194
All right.

562
00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:44,196
<i>Give me two hours.</i>

563
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,397
<i>[Beeps]</i>

[Whirring, thudding continue]

566
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,079
[Mike] Chris.

567
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,117
I'd like you to drop your gun
where you stand,

568
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:21,487
and then turn around
very slowly.

569
00:37:26,692 --> 00:37:28,360
[Gun clatters]

570
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,866
[Sighs]

571
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:39,705
Come on over
and sit next to Chow.

572
00:37:57,355 --> 00:37:59,422
[Exhales forcefully]

573
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:04,293
How much was she gonna pay you?

574
00:38:06,497 --> 00:38:08,664
Ten thousand a name.

575
00:38:10,634 --> 00:38:13,702
How far did you get
down the list?

576
00:38:13,737 --> 00:38:15,270
Just Chow.

577
00:38:15,304 --> 00:38:17,305
I figured I'd start with you.

578
00:38:18,307 --> 00:38:20,642
For you,
she was gonna pay 30,000.

579
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:24,343
I'm very sorry about this, Mike.

580
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,581
But I needed the money.

581
00:38:26,615 --> 00:38:29,617
Those feds,
they took it all, man.

582
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:34,855
I know.

583
00:38:36,156 --> 00:38:37,971
Are you ready?

00:38:38,427 --> 00:38:39,893
Listen, Mike...

[Woman] Kira, come and
have some cookies.

588
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,565
It's a cookie!

589
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,766
It's a cookie, yes!

590

Let's go. Uh-huh.

591
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,671
Vamos a contar.
Let's count.

Well, look at this.
What are you doing?

608
00:39:51,407 --> 00:39:53,843
- Hey, mommy!
- What are you doing still up?

609
00:39:53,877 --> 00:39:55,811
Hey, yourself.
Give me a kiss.

610
00:39:55,846 --> 00:39:57,479
She said she wanted
to wait for you.

611
00:39:57,514 --> 00:39:59,147
She does, huh?

612
00:39:59,181 --> 00:40:01,783
Well, who's the adult
here, Delores?

613
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,785
Tell me she ate
her dinner, at least.

614
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,687
[Delores] Oh, yes,
she ate everything.

615
00:40:05,721 --> 00:40:06,688
She ate her peas,
she ate her carrots.

616
00:40:06,722 --> 00:40:07,689
[Whispering]
Do whatever it takes

617
00:40:07,723 --> 00:40:09,124
to keep them out of here,
or they die.

618
00:40:09,158 --> 00:40:11,860
- Understand?
- She ate a whole lot of carrots this time.

619
00:40:11,894 --> 00:40:14,594
[Kira] - Yep.
- That's right, my girl.

620
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,132
Delores, I'm gonna take a bath.

621
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,135
Put Kira to bed and then go on home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

622
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,303
Really? You don't want
me to wait for you?

623
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,839
- No, you go home.
- Thank you.

Yeah, honey.
After mommy takes a bath.

Okay.

I won't have to
unless you scream.

You know why I'm here?

635
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:11,415
What are you waiting for?

636
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:13,550
The nanny to leave.

637
00:41:14,586 --> 00:41:16,553
If you have anything
to say to me,

638
00:41:16,588 --> 00:41:18,755
now's the time.

Two good men died
because of you.

Don't shoot me in the face.

642
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:34,737
Please.

643
00:41:34,771 --> 00:41:36,839
I don't want my daughter
seeing me like that.

644
00:41:36,873 --> 00:41:39,374
- Your daughter won't see you.
- Yes, she will. She'll find me.

645
00:41:39,408 --> 00:41:41,376
She never once sleeps
through the night.

646
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,212
Nobody's gonna find you, Lydia.

647
00:41:44,247 --> 00:41:46,215
Wait. What?

648
00:41:46,249 --> 00:41:47,983
No.

649
00:41:48,017 --> 00:41:49,784
No. No.

650
00:41:49,818 --> 00:41:52,186
No! Sh-she
has to find me.

651
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:54,588
- Lower your voice.
[Whispering] - She has to find me.

She has to find me.
I-- I--

653
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:58,592
You want your
five-year-old daughter

654
00:41:58,627 --> 00:42:00,594
stumbling across
your dead body?

655
00:42:00,629 --> 00:42:03,697
I can't just disappear.
She has to know I didn't leave her.

656
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:05,932
- She has to know that!
- Keep your voice down.

657
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:07,868
I don't care what you do.

658
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:09,836
I'll scream and
I'll keep screaming.

659
00:42:09,871 --> 00:42:11,504
My daughter's not thinking
I abandoned her!

660
00:42:11,538 --> 00:42:14,775
Shut up and calm down.

661
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:16,676
I don't care.
You have to promise.

662
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,745
You have to promise me...
[Door closes]

663
00:42:27,187 --> 00:42:30,589
Promise I don't disappear.

664
00:42:55,646 --> 00:42:58,481
Can you still get
your hands on methylamine?

665
00:43:02,486 --> 00:43:04,454
Methylamine, Lydia.

666
00:43:04,488 --> 00:43:06,857
Can you still get it?

667
00:43:08,459 --> 00:43:10,026
Maybe.

668
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:13,395
Why?

[Buzzing continues]

673
00:43:37,153 --> 00:43:38,519
Yes?

674

<i>[Mike] You still plan
to move forward?</i>

675
00:43:42,023 --> 00:43:43,690
Yes, we do.

676
00:43:44,726 --> 00:43:48,362
I've reconsidered.
I'm in.

677
00:43:50,498 --> 00:43:51,999
Good.

00:44:10,751 --> 00:44:14,219
Well, you missed a good meal.

680
00:44:14,254 --> 00:44:16,889
The lasagna came out very well,

681
00:44:16,923 --> 00:44:19,024
if I do say so myself.
[Shoe thuds]

682
00:44:21,694 --> 00:44:25,130
I wrapped some up for you
if you'd like some later.

You know, it gets easier.

686

I promise you that it does.

687
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:52,088
What you're feeling
right now...

688
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,826
About, uh, Ted...

689
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,196
Everything...

690
00:45:03,266 --> 00:45:05,200
It'll pass.

what we do for good reasons...

694
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:11,429
then we've got
nothing to worry about.

695
00:46:17,002 --> 00:46:19,303
And there's no better reason...

696
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:22,974
than family.
