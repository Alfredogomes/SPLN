00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:09,173
So I'm on my way
to the drugstore,

94
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,042

to get some gas,

95

and there is this
total pump malfunction.

96
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,414

shouldn't be in this room at all.

101
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:45,827
So, um, pump malfunction?

102
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:49,447
Yeah. So I'm standing there filling up
like I've done a thousand times before,

103
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:51,466
and I hear a chunk.

104
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,551
You know, the pump's nozzle.

105
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:55,636
The-- the metal thing.
The thing you squeeze, right?

106
00:10:55,671 --> 00:11:00,425
I hear a chunk.
So I suppose, in my naivete,

107
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,176
I took to understand that gas

108
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:04,095
is no longer
coming out of the nozzle,

109
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:05,980
so I pull out the hose
to put it back

110
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:07,231
and whoosh!

111
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:10,301

soaked in gasoline.

112
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:14,906

and my legs and my-- my groin.

113

114

It's not until after
I get out of the shower

118
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:29,670
that I realize
my gas-covered clothes

119
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:32,373
have been soaking
in the living room rug

is just so stupid.

00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:40,498

at the station.

I'm starting to realize--

125
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:44,135
wait a minute--
there's a water hose

126
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:46,721

pass out again.

maybe I did get a little
swimmy at one point,

143
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,053
but I did not faint.

180
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:12,700
They could be covering for him.

181
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,452
I posed as a meter reader.

182
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,254
I put a bug in
the tall kid's mom's place.

183
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,655
For three hours straight,

184
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:20,091
all he talked about was
something called <i>Babylon 5.</i>

185
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,710
I checked with my gal at APD.

186
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,679
Uh, she said Pinkman's
not in their system,

187
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:25,829
so the cops don't have him.

188
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:27,515
Yet.

189
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:29,183
Maybe he changed his mind
about leaving,

190
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:30,718
called your guy back.

191
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,337
No. Somebody misses their
first chance with my guy,

192
00:14:33,355 --> 00:14:35,356
there's no second.

193
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,725
Well, keep looking.

194
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,177
What then?

195
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:41,612
What do you mean?

196
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,648
I mean,
Pinkman's like a bad penny.

197
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,116
Sooner or later,
he's gonna turn up.

198
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,019
I'm wondering what
you wanna do when he does.

199
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:50,905
Jesse is upset about the boy.

200
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,157
I just need to explain to him

201
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:54,792
why that had to happen.

202
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,630
Okay, but say, you know,

203
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,582
just for the sake of argument,

204
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:02,866
the kid's not in the mood

205
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:04,919
for a nuanced discussion

206
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,870
of the virtues
of child poisoning.

207
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:10,091
You know, his plans are running
more towards stabbing you to death

208
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,175
with a pointed stick.

209
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:14,178
In that scenario, then what?

210
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,732
You have a suggestion?

211
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:19,100
We were wondering

212
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:24,188
if maybe this isn't
an "Old Yeller" type situation.

213
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,657
"Old Yeller"?

214
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,409
Yeah, Old Yeller was the best,

215
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:30,411
most loyal dog there ever was.

216
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:32,330
I mean,
everybody loved that mutt,

217
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:35,166
but one day he showed up rabid,

218
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,069
and Little Timmy,
for Old Yeller's own sake,

219
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:42,072
had to, uh...

220
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,543
Oh, you--
you saw the movie.

221
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,879
You're full of colorful
metaphors, aren't you, Saul?

222
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:51,632
Belize, Old Yeller.

223
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:53,751
Just brimming with advice.

224
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,810
Do not float that idea again.

225
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:07,782
Find him.

226
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:25,883
Sorry. Ah. Sorry. Room key wouldn't
let me into the ice room,

227
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:29,387
so I had to go down
to the front desk.

228
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,389
But here we are.

229
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,341
Checked in on Junior.

230
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:37,895
Pay-per-view and room service.
He's in heaven.

231
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:41,565
Hey, I thought you
were gonna take a bath.

232
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,819
How's Saul doing?

233
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:48,072
Saul? Goodman?

234
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:52,142
I have no idea.

235
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,695
No?

236
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:57,331
You were just out talking
to him in the parking lot.

237
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:04,255
I'm sorry.
Were you spying on me?

238
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,790
Yes.

239
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,843
And I feel
just awful about it too.

240
00:17:08,877 --> 00:17:10,961
You know, I played along

241
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:13,013
with your
pump malfunction bullshit

242
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:14,998
because Junior
was standing right there,

243
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:18,386
but now I would like
to know what's going on.

244
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,854
[Opens soda can]

245
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,478
First of all, it's no big deal.

246
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:30,781
Coming here is just me
being overly cautious.

247
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,073
Jesse Pinkman, you know?

248
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:44,528
He came over to the house
that time for dinner, remember?

249
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:47,715
Well, he-- he got upset

250
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:50,551
over this--

251
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:53,971
something he thinks I did.

252
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:55,372
I did do it.

253
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,040
But I did it
for very good reasons.

254
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:59,543
It's-- just--
it's complicated.

255
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:03,597
Wait. Are you--
are you telling me

256
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:05,566
that he tried to...

257
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,486
burn our house down?

258
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,356
That was,

259
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,576
probably for a brief moment,
his intention,

260
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,446
but obviously
he changed his mind.

261
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,916
And how does that work?

262
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,918
Him-- him changing his mind?

263
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:28,172
[Sighs]
Ah, God.

264
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:30,073
Look...

With-- You've got
to understand.

266
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,412
With-- with Jesse,

267
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:39,633
there are emotional issues,
personal issues,

268
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:41,385
some drug abuse.

269
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:47,358
But he has always been more of a
danger to himself than anyone else.

270
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,728
He has a tendency
to fly off the handle.

271
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:51,779
That's all.

272
00:18:51,813 --> 00:18:54,865
So he has never hurt anybody?

273
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,496
No.

274
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,042
I can't believe
you got her down so fast.

275
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:11,448
Oh...

276
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:14,718
So...

277
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:17,171
what's your course
of action here?

278
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:22,476
Saul's guy, Kuby,
tracks him down,

279
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,595
which shouldn't take long,

280
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:28,349
and when he does, I'm gonna...

281
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,519
I'm gonna talk to him.

282
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,687
Make him see reason.

283
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:36,323
"Talk to him.

284
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:39,026
Make him see reason."

285
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:45,699
So I'm clear,

286
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,369
these are just euphemisms...

287
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,321
you're using here, right?

288
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:55,342
No. What?

289
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:58,212
Wh-what does that mean?

290
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,663
My God.

291
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:02,550
I knew
this was going to happen.

292
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,551
I knew it.

293
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,335
I told you that someday,

294
00:20:05,353 --> 00:20:08,389
someone was going to come
to our door and try to hurt us.

295
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,890
And now here we are.

296
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:11,174
No.

297
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:13,811
Jesse didn't go there
to hurt anyone.

298
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,147
He poured gasoline
all over our house, Walt.

299
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:19,567
He tried to set
our house on fire.

300
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,019
He changed his mind.
He didn't do it, did he?

301
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:23,237
What if he changes it back?

00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,829
to deal with this.

305
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,414

I-- I don't know
how we got off

on whatever it is
we're talking about here.

310
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,843
But clearly, I haven't explained
the situation well enough,

311
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,211
because this
is a big overreaction.

312

a deep breath and calm down,

isn't just some--

to this person.

362

So you were
fo-following me?

363
00:24:28,797 --> 00:24:31,382
Yeah.
Since Goodman's.

364
00:24:33,168 --> 00:24:35,302
Where we going now?

365
00:24:35,336 --> 00:24:39,890
DEA. Downtown.

366
00:24:39,941 --> 00:24:43,510
What, I'm, like, arrested?

367
00:24:43,528 --> 00:24:45,863
Yeah, you know how this works.

368
00:24:45,897 --> 00:24:47,365
Be a good witness for me,

369
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:50,484
it'll go better for you.

370
00:24:50,518 --> 00:24:53,520
Yeah, sitting around MDC,

371
00:24:53,538 --> 00:24:56,207
waiting to be a witness
against Mr. White.

372

I'm not eating.

376
00:25:20,482 --> 00:25:25,052
Last night I was online for six hours
looking up untraceable poisons.

377
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,054
This close family friend

378
00:25:27,072 --> 00:25:29,407
had been keeping a secret
from you and Hank,

379
00:25:29,441 --> 00:25:33,611
and somehow this person's
secret became known,

380
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:35,830
and now you're sad and hurt

381
00:25:35,864 --> 00:25:38,082
and angry.

382
00:25:40,235 --> 00:25:42,620
I'm--
I'm in the ballpark?

383
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:47,541
To be this wrong about someone.

384
00:25:47,575 --> 00:25:49,627
This off.

385
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:52,913
We all live double-lives
to some extent, don't we?

386
00:25:52,931 --> 00:25:54,748
- We all have our secrets.
- Yeah.

387
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:56,767
Not like this.

388
00:25:58,053 --> 00:26:00,054
Not like him.

389
00:26:01,606 --> 00:26:04,108
Marie, I think it's time
you filled me in

390
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:06,093
on some more details here.

391
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:08,279
Who and what
are we talking about?

392
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:10,231
I said I can't do that.

393
00:26:10,265 --> 00:26:12,817
It'd be bad for Hank.

394
00:26:12,868 --> 00:26:16,287
Our friend made that clear
in his little movie.

395
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:21,659
Those kids...

396
00:26:22,944 --> 00:26:24,912
under his roof.

397
00:26:24,946 --> 00:26:26,280
That baby.

398
00:26:26,314 --> 00:26:30,751
I'm sick
just thinking about it.

399
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:33,420
How could I have not seen this?

400
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,126
If I weren't being such a...

401
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:42,496
idiotic, stupid idiot,
I could've--

402
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:44,532
We could have...

403
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,671
Blackjack winnings.

404
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:53,774
Nothing suspicious
about that at all.

405
00:26:53,808 --> 00:26:56,310
Tell me about this movie.

406
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:59,697
Dave, can't we simply

407
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:01,815
just focus on my feelings here?

408
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,418
The details don't
really matter, do they?

409
00:27:04,452 --> 00:27:06,754
There is nothing
to be done, okay?

410
00:27:06,788 --> 00:27:08,706
He screwed us, and he won.

411
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:11,709
Can we just...

412
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,378
[Sighs] Can we talk about
something else, please?

413
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:16,347
Yes?

414
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:20,000
How's work?

415
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:24,355
Last week, you were upset
about the new parking rules.

416
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:31,529
Marie?

417
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:35,699
Saxitotoxin.

418
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:37,701
"Derived from shellfish.

419

422

That is definitely a contender.

423

Marie,

424
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:56,470
you're not ready
to fill me in here,

425
00:27:56,504 --> 00:27:58,839
that's fine.

426
00:27:58,873 --> 00:28:01,875
But I want you to listen.

427
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:05,312
There is no problem,
no matter how difficult

428
00:28:05,347 --> 00:28:08,715
or painful
or seemingly unsolvable,

429
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:10,517
that violence won't make worse.

430
00:28:11,987 --> 00:28:14,405
I know. I...

431
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:16,574
Don't worry.
I wouldn't hurt anybody.

432
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:19,243

to think about it.

[Door opens]

436
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:36,677
- Hey, babe.
- What's the story here?

437
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:38,929
Oh, uh, well, uh,
something's come up.

438
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:41,265
I thought you might wanna
get outta the house for a day or two.

439
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:44,351
You thought I might wanna
pack up and move out of my own house.

440
00:28:44,386 --> 00:28:45,936
Why?
What's going on?

441
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:48,355
Look, I don't wanna
get into it now.

442
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,774
But you know that thing with Walt?
There's, uh--

443
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:52,776
there's been a development.

444
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:54,612
What happened?
Are you in danger?

445
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:56,280
No. No, no, no,
not at all.

446
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:58,399
Just--
it's a fluid situation,

447
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:00,985
and I think it might go a little
smoother if you're not here.

448
00:29:01,036 --> 00:29:03,437
So, I, uh--
it'll be great, you know?

449

a spa package at La Posada.

is going on?

Gave him a couple sleeping pills.

Okay. So listen.

458
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,858
I bring that kid in and--
and put him in the system,

459
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:42,476
Walt's gonna find out
five minutes later.

460
00:29:42,494 --> 00:29:45,979
You know, my last ten witnesses
died in jail, remember?

461

A-a-and I can't use a DEA safe
house without writing him up.

I can't risk a-- a motel.

463

I know it sounds crazy,
but this is the best place for him.

464
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:55,956
For now.
Just for a day or two, tops.

465
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,492
Okay, just answer me
this one question...

466
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,494
Is this bad for Walt?

467
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:02,046
Yeah. Very.

00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:43,847
I-I got stories
that'll make your toes curl,

540
00:35:43,898 --> 00:35:47,818
but, you know, it's just
"My word against his word" kind of stuff.

541
00:35:47,852 --> 00:35:51,188
So, you know, I don't really have
any, like, proof or anything.

542
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,190
Gomie, can you, uh, grab
the curtains over there?

543
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:55,909
There's a--
there's a glare thing happening here.

544
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,198
You know he's retired,
right? He's--

545
00:36:01,249 --> 00:36:03,333
he's not even
in the business anymore.

546
00:36:03,368 --> 00:36:05,502
So you're never gonna catch him
with a camcorder.

547
00:36:05,537 --> 00:36:06,987
We're gonna catch him.

548
00:36:07,005 --> 00:36:09,123
We gotta do this first, okay?
Come on.

549
00:36:16,131 --> 00:36:18,899
Just, uh, tell us
everything you remember.

550
00:36:18,933 --> 00:36:22,386
Any business dealings,
any personal dealings,

551
00:36:22,437 --> 00:36:25,773
any criminal activity you
were a witness or a party to.

552
00:36:25,807 --> 00:36:27,691
Anything and everything.

553
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:30,227
Just tell us your story, okay?
[Beeps]

554
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:33,346
Start from the beginning.

555
00:36:33,364 --> 00:36:35,849
When did you
first meet Walter White?

556
00:36:37,952 --> 00:36:40,404
Right. Okay, uh...

557
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:46,577
I first met Mr. White--

558
00:36:46,628 --> 00:36:48,879
Walter White--

559
00:36:48,913 --> 00:36:52,082
in junior year chemistry.

560
00:36:54,669 --> 00:36:57,037
He was my teacher.

561
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:13,904
You believe him?

562
00:37:13,938 --> 00:37:16,690
Yeah.
I do, unfortunately.

563
00:37:16,724 --> 00:37:18,692
And I hate to admit it,

564
00:37:18,726 --> 00:37:21,278
but I think the kid is right.

565
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:23,730
There is no physical evidence,
not that I heard.

566
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:25,899
Yeah, well, no weapons,

567
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:28,502
no bodies, no working lab.

568
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:31,371
Just the word of one nut-job
meth-head

569
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:34,041
against
Mr. Rogers-Has-A-Lung-Tumor.

570
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:36,260
So, do we take a run
at Lydia Rodarte-Quayle?

571
00:37:36,294 --> 00:37:39,596
Vamonos Pest? Follow up
with the Drew Sharp killing?

572
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:41,098
Where do we start?

573
00:37:41,132 --> 00:37:44,084
I say we start with this.

575
00:37:46,437 --> 00:37:50,891

576
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:52,893
<i>I hope you'll</i>

577
00:37:52,927 --> 00:37:55,262
<i>to explain myself</i>

578
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,615
<i>and talk through everything</i>

579
00:38:00,618 --> 00:38:04,104
<i>I'll be alone and unarmed.</i>

580
00:38:04,122 --> 00:38:06,824
<i>So if you wanna come</i>
<i>and shoot me in the head,</i>

581
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:09,209
<i>that's up to you.</i>

582
00:38:10,378 --> 00:38:13,463
<i>Either way,</i>

583
00:38:13,498 --> 00:38:15,999
<i>I'm in your hands.</i>

584
00:38:26,811 --> 00:38:29,129
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

585
00:38:29,147 --> 00:38:31,131
Go and talk to that asshole?

586
00:38:31,149 --> 00:38:33,133
You-- you can't
be serious.

587
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:34,634
Go and listen.

588
00:38:34,652 --> 00:38:36,353
He wants to explain himself.

589
00:38:36,404 --> 00:38:38,972
We put a wire on you
and let him explain.

590
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:42,142
So your plan is to do his plan?

591
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,161
You-- you seriously think
that this--

592
00:38:44,195 --> 00:38:47,281
this whole "Once and for all
in the Plaza" thing

593
00:38:47,315 --> 00:38:48,782
is so he can talk to me?

594
00:38:48,816 --> 00:38:51,335
Why not?

595
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:54,487
I-- I--
I can't believe you two.

596
00:38:54,505 --> 00:38:58,091
The dude wanted me out of town before
I came to burn his house down,

597
00:38:58,126 --> 00:39:00,294
and now I'm even more
of a threat to him, okay?

598
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:03,213
And he's got a zero-tolerance
policy on threats, you know?

599
00:39:03,264 --> 00:39:06,550
If I go to this Plaza,
I'm a dead man is why not.

600
00:39:06,601 --> 00:39:08,719
Hey, Walt's ruthless.

601
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,939
He'll do just about anything
to protect his interests.

602
00:39:11,973 --> 00:39:15,726
I agree.
Except when it comes to you.

603
00:39:15,777 --> 00:39:18,729
He cares about you.
[Scoffs]

604
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,564
Can't you see?

605
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:22,866
Oh, yeah.
You mean when he's not,

606
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:25,702
uh, ripping me off
or calling me an idiot

607
00:39:25,737 --> 00:39:28,789
or poisoning people
that I care about?

608
00:39:28,823 --> 00:39:31,742
Yeah, no, Mr. White's gay for me.
Everyone knows that.

609
00:39:31,793 --> 00:39:34,995
No, I mean it.
Based on everything you told us.

610
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:37,047
Uh, he paid for your rehab,

611
00:39:37,081 --> 00:39:39,299
uh, ran over those two
drug dealers with his car.

612
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:41,084
Sounds like he saved your life.

613
00:39:41,135 --> 00:39:43,503
Uh, made you a 50-50 partner.
He didn't need to do that.

614
00:39:43,537 --> 00:39:46,773
Yeah, no, he sort of did. I'm the
only one near as good as him, so...

615
00:39:46,808 --> 00:39:48,442
I don't know.
The way you tell it,

616
00:39:48,476 --> 00:39:50,811
sounds to me like he's
manipulating you to stick around.

617
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:52,312
Like he doesn't wanna lose you.

618
00:39:52,347 --> 00:39:54,231
All those numbers
he-- he runs on you,

619
00:39:54,265 --> 00:39:56,900
over and over,
helping you find the ricin cigarette.

620
00:39:56,935 --> 00:39:58,902
Come on.
Look how far he'll go to show you--

621
00:39:58,937 --> 00:40:01,772
to convince you
that he's not such a bad guy.

622
00:40:01,823 --> 00:40:04,391
- That's what this is.
- What if it's about, um,

623
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:06,393
killing me, you know?

624
00:40:06,411 --> 00:40:08,745
You know, getting me
out in the open,

625
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,332
hire some, uh--
some clock tower guy,

626
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:15,902
or-- or have me sit on a poison needle,
or something, you know?

627
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,404
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

628
00:40:17,422 --> 00:40:19,406
I mean, the Plaza's
one of the most wide-open

629
00:40:19,424 --> 00:40:21,241
public places
in all of Albuquerque.

630
00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:22,742
It's middle of the day.

631
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,928
And Agent Gomez and I
will be right there with you.

632
00:40:24,963 --> 00:40:27,080
Look--
look, you two guys

633
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:31,134
are just... guys, okay?

634
00:40:31,185 --> 00:40:34,921
Mr. White--
he's the devil.

635
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:37,641
You know, he is--
he is smarter than you,

636
00:40:37,692 --> 00:40:39,693
he is luckier than you.

637
00:40:39,727 --> 00:40:41,945
Whatever-- whatever you think
is supposed to happen--

638
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,098
I'm telling you,
the exact reverse opposite

639
00:40:45,116 --> 00:40:47,100
of that is gonna happen, okay?

640
00:40:47,118 --> 00:40:51,038
Jesse-- Jesse,
we're not brainstorming here.

641
00:40:51,072 --> 00:40:53,323
This is not asking.

642
00:40:53,374 --> 00:40:55,492
Unless you know
another way to get the man,

643
00:40:55,543 --> 00:40:57,160
or unless
you wanna take your chances

644
00:40:57,211 --> 00:40:59,212
with the banger boys
over in MDC,

645
00:40:59,247 --> 00:41:00,881
then this is it.

646
00:41:00,915 --> 00:41:03,450
This is what's happening.

647
00:41:03,468 --> 00:41:05,452
I gotta piss.
Can I piss?

648
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:08,121
Yeah.
Down to the left.

649
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:12,292
You got another SD card?

650
00:41:14,178 --> 00:41:16,430
[Exhales forcefully]
What?

651
00:41:16,464 --> 00:41:19,316
What if the kid's right?
What if it's a trap?

652
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,685
"The kid"?

653
00:41:21,736 --> 00:41:24,237
Oh, you mean
the junkie murderer

654
00:41:24,272 --> 00:41:26,473
that's dribbling all over
my guest bathroom floor?

655
00:41:28,192 --> 00:41:30,360
Well, then, he's right.

656
00:41:30,411 --> 00:41:32,812
Pinkman gets killed,

657
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,332
and we get it all on tape.

658
00:41:41,736 --> 00:41:44,004
[Hank] Remember, you're
hurt, you're angry,

659
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,006
but you're here
for answers, okay?

660
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,676
But don't, uh--
don't push the questions, okay?

661
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,178
Let's not get him suspicious,
all right?

662
00:41:51,212 --> 00:41:54,265
You let him do the talking,
right?

663
00:41:54,316 --> 00:41:56,400
Just relax. That's what--
that's what matters most.

664
00:41:56,434 --> 00:41:58,435
Don't cross your arms,
if you can help it.

665
00:42:01,323 --> 00:42:02,856

<i>You getting that?</i>

667
00:42:04,993 --> 00:42:06,694
Loud and clear, <i>idiota.</i>

668
00:42:06,728 --> 00:42:08,228
<i>How's it looking, Gomie?</i>

669
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,915
[Gomez]
No change.

670
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:12,866
<i>He's just sitting there.</i>

671
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,835
<i>Are we doing this, or what?</i>

672
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:16,870
Ready to kick some ass, partner?
[Pats]

673
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:23,294
All right.
Time to go.

[Gomez] Hey, Hank, you got eyes on this?
What's with the kid?

681
00:43:45,326 --> 00:43:47,327
He's just standing there.

682

<i>What the hell's he doing?</i>

683
00:44:11,736 --> 00:44:14,371
He's on the move now.

684
00:44:14,406 --> 00:44:15,989
He's taking off.
I think he's running.

685
00:44:16,023 --> 00:44:18,191
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, kid.
Come on.

686

[Gomez] You got him?
He's at the pay phone.

687

00:44:34,426 --> 00:44:36,677
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Come on, kid.

Get in.

710
00:46:02,897 --> 00:46:04,798
Little son of a bitch!

711
00:46:04,816 --> 00:46:06,466
Stupid, high little--

712
00:46:06,484 --> 00:46:08,134
What the hell
was that all about, huh?

713
00:46:08,153 --> 00:46:09,653
What were you thinking?

714
00:46:09,687 --> 00:46:11,688
- Thinking there's another way.
- What?

715
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,492
To get him.
There's another way.

716
00:46:17,662 --> 00:46:19,613
A better way.

Uh...

721
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,767
Hey.

722
00:46:40,802 --> 00:46:42,636
It's Walt.

723
00:46:47,341 --> 00:46:49,193
I'm okay.

724
00:46:49,227 --> 00:46:51,311
I, uh...

725
00:46:53,031 --> 00:46:54,781
Todd,

726
00:46:54,816 --> 00:46:58,285
I think I might have
