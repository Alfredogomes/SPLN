00:01:15,168 --> 00:01:16,608
I got it, I got it.

3
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,696
Just--

4
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:19,968
You're like a bee
at a damn picnic, Marie.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,920
Bzzz.
Good morning.

6
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:23,648
Hey, buddy.

7
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,440
Ready to get your rocks on?

8
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:26,656
See? I knew it.

9
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:28,928
"Mineral show" is just
some sort of guy code

10
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,368
for strip club.

11
00:01:30,432 --> 00:01:32,064
Hey, you got any singles?

12
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:34,816
- Got it?
- Yeah.

13
00:01:34,848 --> 00:01:36,192
Yeah.

14
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:41,152
Don't let him
get too crazy, okay?

15
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,424
Cram one more giant geode
in here,

16
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:44,992
we'll be sleeping
in the garage.

17
00:01:45,024 --> 00:01:45,984
Got it.
I got it.

18
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:47,040
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:54,976
Christ.

20
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:56,608
Longest week ever.

21
00:01:58,048 --> 00:02:00,384
I just hope we get
something good, you know?

22
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,272
Keep your fingers crossed.

23
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:09,376
Relax, buddy.
This ain't no spy movie.

24
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:13,312

32
00:03:22,272 --> 00:03:23,264
Leaving.

33
00:03:23,296 --> 00:03:24,512
No, you got to go inside

34
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:25,792
and order something
like last time

35
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,976
to avoid suspicion.

36
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:29,760
Besides,
I want a vanilla shake.

37
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,288
We'll use the drive-through.

38
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,112
All right, baby.
Let's see what we got.

39
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,920
What the hell?

40
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:05,792
Look at this.
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.

41
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:09,536
That's work, that's home,
that's work, that's home.

42
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:13,952
What, this guy goes
two places every day all week?

43
00:04:13,984 --> 00:04:16,640
It's unbelievable.

44
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:19,168
Chicken-slinging
son of a bitch.

45
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:23,936
Hank, is it possible that...

46
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:26,848
maybe, just maybe...

47
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,928
he's not your guy?

48
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,808
Oh, a guy this clean's
got to be dirty.

49
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:36,768
What's the play here, buddy?

50
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,688
How do I get this guy?

51
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:41,568
Yeah.

52
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,040
How?

53
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,376
Yes, hi.

54
00:05:45,408 --> 00:05:48,704
I live on the 4900 block
of Doswell Place,

55
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:51,808
and I want to report
a very suspicious man

56
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,760
who's lurking
in my neighborhood.

57
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:55,360
He's sitting in a blue Sedan,

58
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:57,856
and he-- He's been staring
at a particular house

59
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:59,232
for a very long time.

60
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:01,984
Thank you. Thank you so much.

61
00:06:02,016 --> 00:06:04,704
If you would,
I would appreciate it.

62
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:39,232
All right.

63
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:41,344
So I guess we better
get started.

64
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:43,616
I already did.

65
00:06:46,624 --> 00:06:47,616
Yeah?

66
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:54,112
Hey, uh...

67
00:06:58,112 --> 00:06:59,744
You got one of those for me?

68
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:01,152
One of those what?

69
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:02,176
Cigarette.

70
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:07,872
Like, it's still in there,
all right?

71
00:07:07,904 --> 00:07:09,760
I didn't get a chance yet.

72
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:15,648
Just give me one.

73
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:36,352
Hmm.

74
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:43,360
So what have you been up to?

75
00:07:43,392 --> 00:07:44,928
What?

76
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,032
You know, just
a day in the life.

77
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:49,760
What do you do after work?

78
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,008
Go home, watch TV.

79
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,544
What do you watch?

80
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,400
I don't know. Stuff.

81
00:07:58,432 --> 00:07:59,936
Like what?

82
00:08:03,136 --> 00:08:05,472
Like, uh...

83
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:07,232
<i>Ice Road Truckers.</i>

84
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:09,888
<i>Ice Road Truckers.</i>

85
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,584
What happens on that one?

86
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,912
Guys drive on ice.

87
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:22,240
I am going to do it.

88
00:08:29,536 --> 00:08:31,648
You got to inhale, by the way.

89
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,952
What the hell, man, don't you
have enough cancer already?

90
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:43,392
Look, I said...I'd do it.

91
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:45,056
I'll do it.

92
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:50,816
Yeah, well,
what does it matter?

93
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:53,088
We're both dead men anyway.

94
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:29,152
<i>Hi.</i>

95
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:30,432
Hi.

96
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:33,152
Am I, uh, catching you
at a bad time?

97
00:09:33,184 --> 00:09:35,744
No, I have a few minutes.

98
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:38,720
So Mr. I'm Almost 16
So Leave Me Alone

99
00:09:38,784 --> 00:09:40,416
doesn't want a big thing
for his birthday.

100
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:42,272
He just wants to hang out
with his friends,

101
00:09:42,304 --> 00:09:43,776
which is fine by me. You?

102
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:45,152
Fine by me.

103
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,095
<i>Okay. So I figured, uh,</i>

104
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:50,368
<i>low-key family dinner,
no official party,</i>

105
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,248
<i>and we bite the bullet and...</i>

106
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:56,032
buy him a car--

107
00:09:56,064 --> 00:09:59,488
Uh, used, I was thinking,
would be best.

108
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,376
But no more
than five years old.

109
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:04,672
Air bags, safety rated,
all that.

110
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,912
Do you, um, have any thoughts

111
00:10:06,944 --> 00:10:08,352
on what kind,

112
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,264
or should I
just go ahead and--

113
00:10:11,296 --> 00:10:14,208
Yeah. No, you just go ahead.

114
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,360
<i>Okay.</i>

115
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,808
<i>Listen. On another subject,</i>

116
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,208
<i>I just wanted to tell you that</i>

117
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,544
business is good.

118
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:26,912
Really good.

119
00:10:26,944 --> 00:10:31,136
So good that I'm thinking
maybe...

120
00:10:31,168 --> 00:10:35,424
you don't even need
to work your second job.

121
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:43,456
You're turning a profit?

122
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:44,992
<i>We're coming close.</i>

123
00:10:45,056 --> 00:10:46,304
Give us another month or two,

124
00:10:46,336 --> 00:10:50,976
and, uh, yeah, we'll be there.

125
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:53,728
All of this to say

126
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,536
maybe you could start thinking
about an exit strategy.

127
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,624
I'm working on it.

128
00:11:05,376 --> 00:11:06,592
Okay.

129
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,216
Hello.

130
00:11:37,248 --> 00:11:38,912
<i>Hey, buddy. Wake you?</i>

131
00:11:41,696 --> 00:11:43,360
No, Hank, I'm up.

132
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:46,400
Oh, good. Uh, what you doing?

133
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:48,224
<i>I'm, uh...</i>

134
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:49,696
Hey, listen,
I-I'll cut to it.

135
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:51,136
I got another favor to ask.

136
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,640
<i>I've been thinking
about this Gus Fring, right?</i>

137
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,400
<i>How he never goes anywhere,</i>

138
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:55,968
<i>one restaurant, home,
one restaurant, home,</i>

139
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,216
<i>back and forth back and forth?</i>

140
00:11:57,248 --> 00:11:58,400
<i>Which, now I'm even
more convinced</i>

141
00:11:58,432 --> 00:12:00,000
<i>is bullshit, because
the man owns</i>

142
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:02,048
<i>13 other restaurants, right?</i>

143
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,088
So I started thinking about this
little empire of his, right?

144
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,720
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?

145
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:09,184
What's the base of operations?

146
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:11,584
So I do a little diggin',
and bingo!

147
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:14,464
Pollos Hermanos has
a main distribution center.

148
00:12:14,496 --> 00:12:16,000
<i>Uh... It's not far from town.</i>

149
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:18,528
The place is huge.
I mean--

150
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,192
I'm looking at it
online right now.

151
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:22,176
I tell you, it's
a big warehouse

152
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,728
and rows of these
long poultry buildings,

153
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,776
or hatcheries, or
whatever you call 'em.

154
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:30,624
<i>Lots of space to hide
illicit activity.</i>

155
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:33,440
<i>Sounds promising, right?</i>

156
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:34,816
Huh.

157
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:36,832
<i>So. Whaddya say, buddy?</i>

158
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:40,000
<i>Got another field trip in you?</i>

159
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:41,056
Uhh...

160
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,216
You know, Hank. Um...

161
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:46,912
I mean, it sounds great.

162
00:12:46,944 --> 00:12:49,504
It really does. But I--

163
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:52,192
You know, I won't lie, uh--

164
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:56,800
You caught me...
somewhat...

165
00:12:56,832 --> 00:12:59,136
indisposed.

166
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:01,216
What do you mean, like
taking a dump indisposed?

167
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,312
Yeah. That's--

168
00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:07,840
Embarrassingly, that's it.

169
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:11,232
You know, it's just...

170
00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:12,800
upset stomach, you know,
and everything...

171
00:13:12,832 --> 00:13:15,968
<i>- Yeah.
- It's out of control.</i>

172
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,272
Really explosive.

173
00:13:18,304 --> 00:13:20,320
Bad Tex-Mex.

174
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:22,272
- At the mall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:25,312
I get it. You don't have
to paint me a picture.

176
00:13:25,344 --> 00:13:27,264
Probably one guy in a diaper
is enough for this trip anyway.

177
00:13:27,296 --> 00:13:29,088
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry, Hank.</i>

178
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,624
Hey, don't be.

179
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:32,096
I've been asking a lot
of you lately.

180
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:33,664
I appreciate it.

181
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:36,800
I'll find another
ride for this one.

182
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:40,672
Another ride?

183
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:42,848
Yeah. I'm sure I can get
someone else to take me.

184
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,672
Uh, my trainer, Chuck.

185
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:46,208
Maybe I'll ask him.

186
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,808
<i>Look, I'm-- I'm--</i>

187
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,368
<i>This is probably
just a 24-hour thing.</i>

188
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,640
Maybe 48 hours, at the most.

189
00:13:52,672 --> 00:13:54,272
And, um...

190
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:56,800
Do you think you could
possibly hold off

191
00:13:56,832 --> 00:13:58,592
for a day or two?

192
00:13:58,624 --> 00:14:02,464
Aw, jeez, buddy.
I mean, I-- You know--

193
00:14:02,496 --> 00:14:04,032
<i>You know, I just--</i>

194
00:14:04,064 --> 00:14:05,472
<i>I would just really...</i>

195
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:08,096
love to be the one
to be able to--

196
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:10,016
to take you there, and--

197
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:14,720
I mean, I have just
really enjoyed, you know,

198
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:16,704
the time with you,

199
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:19,936
<i>- and helping you.
- Well, yeah.</i>

200
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,464
Okay, sure. If it means
that much to you.

201
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:25,280
Just, you know, give me a call

202
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:26,944
when you're feeling
up to it, all right?

203
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:30,656
Thank you.
I will. Okay.

204
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:32,192
Bye.

205
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,584
<i>- Yeah.
- Uh, Mike.</i>

206
00:14:55,616 --> 00:14:58,528
Listen. I just want to say,
first off,

207
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,288
don't be angry.

208
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
<i>What is it, Walter?</i>

209
00:15:01,472 --> 00:15:02,880
My brother-in-law,

210
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:06,144
My DEA-- He--

211
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:08,608
Soon, he will probably,

212
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,488
in the near future,
take a ride out to

213
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,376
a certain distribution center,

214
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:16,832
to look around for things.

215
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,248
Look around for things.
And... Yeah.

216
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,608
Uh.

217
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:31,360
Mike?

218
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:52,608
- Where's this all going?
- Elsewhere.

219
00:16:01,952 --> 00:16:03,712
You're all set.

220
00:16:03,744 --> 00:16:06,720
Thank you. Please give this
to your car care professional.

221
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:20,800
So. A hand wax
for you today?

222
00:16:20,832 --> 00:16:23,680
Okay. Great.

223
00:16:27,776 --> 00:16:30,112
Please give this to your
car care professional.

224
00:16:30,144 --> 00:16:31,584
And the black Explorer?

225
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,920
Well, of course we could shampoo
your floor mats, but really,

226
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,192
deluxe detailing is
the best bang for your buck.

227
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:38,624
Oh, and SUVs are extra.

228
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,688
And please give this to
your car care professional.

229
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,032
Thank you!

230
00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:47,104
Please give this to
your car care professional.

231
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,536
Hey, Sky.

232
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,800
Oh, my God.
Ted.

233
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:58,400
What are you, uh--

234
00:16:58,432 --> 00:16:59,224
Someone from the office, uh,

235
00:17:00,256 --> 00:17:02,592
said you worked down here,
so I thought I'd...

236
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:04,192
come down and say hi.

237
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:05,472
Wow. Well, uh...

238
00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:08,384
Hello.

239
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,792
You look great.

240
00:17:09,824 --> 00:17:12,192
No. I'm gonna like--

241
00:17:12,224 --> 00:17:13,728
I probably just look crazed.

242
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,512
Not at all.
You look happy.

243
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:18,272
Last time I saw you--

244
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:25,632
Hi, there.

245
00:17:25,664 --> 00:17:27,136
Uh, thing is,

246
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:29,184
Skyler, um,

247
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,200
I really need to talk to you.

248
00:17:33,728 --> 00:17:36,320
Ted,

249
00:17:36,352 --> 00:17:39,424
I really don't think we have
anything to talk about.

250
00:17:40,896 --> 00:17:43,328
Actually, we do.

251
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,248
An audit?

252
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,920
Wait, an audit tomorrow?

253
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:52,160
How long have you had this?

254
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:54,752
Awhile. I'd...

255
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:56,896
debated, you know,
contacting you.

256
00:17:56,928 --> 00:17:59,200
Contact me? What about
a lawyer? Ted--

257
00:17:59,232 --> 00:18:01,920
Ted, this is--

258
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:03,424
This is the CID.

259
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:06,720
The Criminal Division.

260
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,688
My God, you facing
a felony charge here.

261
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,408
$100,000 fine
on top of the taxes

262
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,104
you already owe, plus

263
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,768
five years in prison!

264
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,720
Yeah. It's bad.

265
00:18:18,752 --> 00:18:21,696
Yeah.
It most certainly is.

266
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:24,576
Look, here's the thing.

267
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:28,288
I was wondering, maybe, if um,

268
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,984
there's some way
you could help with this.

269
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:34,240
Help? Help how?

270
00:18:34,272 --> 00:18:37,568
Well, with your knowledge
of how the books

271
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,744
got the way they are,
maybe there's some way

272
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:41,696
you could, uh,

273
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:44,128
undo what's in there.

274
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,424
You want me to
uncook your books?

275
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:50,272
Maybe there's some method,
or some accounting trick

276
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:52,960
- you could, you know, use--
- Ted.

277
00:18:52,992 --> 00:18:54,944
It doesn't work like that.

278
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:57,408
The damage is already--

279
00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:05,792
My name. My signatures

280
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:09,024
are all over those books.

281
00:19:09,056 --> 00:19:11,456
Skyler, I'm accountable,
not you.

282
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:14,208
Let me explain what's
gonna happen here, okay?

283
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,792
Once the CID sees this
as willful tax fraud,

284
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,872
there are going to build
the strongest possible case

285
00:19:19,904 --> 00:19:22,464
against you, and once
they start down that path,

286
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:25,184
they have an 80%
conviction rate.

287
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:28,576
That's because they're allowed
to monitor your mail,

288
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:32,832
and tap your phones--
and not just you, Ted.

289
00:19:32,864 --> 00:19:36,000
Everyone involved
in those books.

290
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,016
I can't have this in my life.

291
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,640
I cannot be audited.

292
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:45,952
Skyler, you-- you--

293
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,576
You're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.

294
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:51,840
It's the captain they want,
not some cashier at a car wash.

295
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,472
No offense. I'm sorry.

296
00:19:57,504 --> 00:20:00,864
I, uh,

297
00:20:00,896 --> 00:20:03,168
I don't want you
to worry, okay?

298
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:06,880
I'm gonna figure out
a way through this.

299
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:08,832
Somehow. Okay?

300
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:20,896
Here.

301
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,496
Right here.

302
00:20:39,232 --> 00:20:40,544
So is he gonna kill him?

303
00:20:44,768 --> 00:20:46,176
Is who gonna kill who?

304
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:50,528
Gus.

305
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,088
Is he gonna kill
Mr. White's brother-in-law?

306
00:20:56,576 --> 00:20:59,616
I mean, he's the reason
for all this here, right?

307
00:21:02,368 --> 00:21:07,232
Because it's totally logical
for him to off the dude.

308
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:12,320
A-hole DEA agent,

309
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:14,304
pokin' around your junk--

310
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,208
Who needs that, right?

311
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,296
Makes sense
to get rid of him...

312
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,984
for good.

313
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,856
But killing a cop--

314
00:21:33,888 --> 00:21:37,216
I don't know.

315
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:39,808
It could look suspicious
if, uh,

316
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,176
the dude who's
investigating you

317
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,224
suddenly up and dies.

318
00:21:49,504 --> 00:21:52,160
Then there's--
There's Mr. White.

319
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:56,608
Who'd be even more ape shit

320
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,568
if he had family
getting murdered.

321
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,488
He'd never cook for Gus again.

322
00:22:13,408 --> 00:22:17,760
Guess there's a lot
of angles to consider.

323
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,840
If something were
to happen to the man,

324
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:25,920
would you have
a problem with that?

325
00:22:31,744 --> 00:22:33,760
Who really cares what I think?

326
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,136
Son of a bitch!

327
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,712
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.

328
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:52,160
- Hey.
- Get down!

329
00:24:50,848 --> 00:24:52,192
<i>Sí.</i>

330
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,712
- Should I even ask?
- I wouldn't.

331
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:50,816
So what? Is this going
to be a regular thing now?

332
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,312
Meth cooking
and corpse disposal? Jesus.

333
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:56,160
Just grab us
a spare barrel, Walter.

334
00:25:58,656 --> 00:25:59,840
What was it this time?

335
00:25:59,904 --> 00:26:03,264
What did this poor bastard do
to piss off Gus?

336
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:05,344
Or did Gus just need
to send another message?

337
00:26:05,376 --> 00:26:07,712
Shut your mouth.

338
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,400
You shut your mouth,
or I'll shut it for you.

339
00:26:10,432 --> 00:26:12,320
I don't want you talking
to me or Jesse.

340
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,240
Just get the barrel.

341
00:26:15,648 --> 00:26:17,792
And if you ever plan
on calling the cops

342
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:21,056
on one of my guys again,

343
00:26:21,088 --> 00:26:23,712
you go ahead
and get two barrels.

344
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:03,840
Yo, like, uh,

345
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,296
I guess I never thanked you for

346
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:08,864
what you did.

347
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,128
Thanks.

348
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,792
Next time, don't stand there
like an idiot.

349
00:27:17,824 --> 00:27:20,896
Move your feet,
run and so forth.

350
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,192
But seriously,
what--

351
00:27:24,224 --> 00:27:25,536
What was the deal with Gus?

352
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,992
- The deal?
- The Terminator shit?

353
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,976
Walking right into the bullets?

354
00:27:31,008 --> 00:27:33,856
What the hell was he doing?

355
00:27:33,888 --> 00:27:36,416
The cartel needs Gus.

356
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:37,984
His distribution network.

357
00:27:38,016 --> 00:27:39,680
They're not looking
to kill him.

358
00:27:39,744 --> 00:27:43,296
But what? The rest of us
are like, open season?

359
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,864
Is he doing anything
about that?

360
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,176
Or do we just keep hanging out

361
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,488
for target practice
while he's--

362
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,248
Kid.

363
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,800
Enough. You got questions,

364
00:27:52,832 --> 00:27:54,112
ask him yourself.

365
00:28:05,536 --> 00:28:10,912
And here again.
Unreported income.

366
00:28:10,944 --> 00:28:14,784
That's more than
a year straight so far.

367
00:28:14,816 --> 00:28:16,320
Do you want to say
something about this?

368
00:28:16,352 --> 00:28:19,296
Because I'm having
a hard time figuring it out.

369
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:23,360
Well, I-- I'd have to, um,

370
00:28:23,392 --> 00:28:25,472
have a look at the copies
of the receipts

371
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,072
to refresh my memory.

372
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:28,928
Take all the time
you need, Mr. Beneke.

373
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,040
That's why we're here.

374
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,688
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.

375
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,224
I got lost.

376
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:42,400
- Hey, Ted.
- Sky.

377
00:28:42,432 --> 00:28:43,520
Whoo!

378
00:28:43,552 --> 00:28:45,888
This building is so confusing.

379
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,296
There are doors everywhere.

380
00:28:47,328 --> 00:28:49,024
Hi. You are--

381
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:50,848
Special Agent James Bekaris.

382
00:28:50,912 --> 00:28:52,672
Ooh. Special.

383
00:28:52,704 --> 00:28:54,880
Skyler White.

384
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,728
Ms. White. You are
the accountant

385
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,424
of record for many
of these reports.

386
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:01,056
- Is that correct?
- Guilty as charged.

387
00:29:01,088 --> 00:29:03,008
Well then, perhaps you can
shed some light

388
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,864
on this history
of missing revenue.

389
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,656
Missing?
Uh-huh.

390
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,672
- No, it's there.
- No.

391
00:29:08,704 --> 00:29:11,264
Revenue most definitely
flowed through this company.

392
00:29:11,328 --> 00:29:13,504
But it's not all accounted for
in your reports.

393
00:29:13,536 --> 00:29:16,096
Huh!

394
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,760
Hmm, let's take a look.

395
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,392
Hmm. Oh.

396
00:29:23,424 --> 00:29:26,112
Well, you know,
this account here?

397
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,160
That is Mr. Keller's account,

398
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,008
and Mr. Keller's
an old friend of Ted's dad,

399
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,600
and he always sends
an electronic payment,

400
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:34,752
which personally I hate,

401
00:29:34,784 --> 00:29:36,448
because
I'm a real paper person,

402
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,232
but Mr. Keller's one
of those environmental people.

403
00:29:39,296 --> 00:29:41,600
So anyway, since there
wasn't a physical check,

404
00:29:41,632 --> 00:29:44,352
I didn't enter it
into the book, but...

405
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:46,496
the money's there.

406
00:29:47,872 --> 00:29:50,912
Ms. White, you've read
Section 61 of the IRC?

407
00:29:50,944 --> 00:29:54,080
I... did not follow
what you just said.

408
00:29:54,144 --> 00:29:58,208
How gross income for a
business is defined.

409
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,224
- You're not allowed to do that.
- Well, I think I am.

410
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,824
No, you're not.

411
00:30:01,856 --> 00:30:03,936
Well, you know what they say
about opinions, right?

412
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,912
Everyone's got one.

413
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:09,568
But seriously, I am.

414
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,488
Look, it doesn't matter
if its an electronic check

415
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,856
or a paper check,
income is income.

416
00:30:13,888 --> 00:30:15,968
You're not allowed
to not declare it.

417
00:30:16,032 --> 00:30:19,392
When I input everything
into the Quicken,

418
00:30:19,424 --> 00:30:21,856
nothing flashed red,
so that's gotta mean

419
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:24,832
it's okay, right?

420
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,944
Quicken.
Uh-huh.

421
00:30:26,976 --> 00:30:29,664
You used Quicken
to manage books

422
00:30:29,696 --> 00:30:31,328
for a business this size.

423
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,344
I did. Oh, do you guys
use that here?

424
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:34,944
'Cause it is the best.

425
00:30:34,976 --> 00:30:38,176
It's like having a calculator
on your computer. Amazing.

426
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:40,128
Ms. White, how did you
get this job?

427
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,016
- Oh, Ted hired me.
- No.

428
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,544
I mean your qualifications.

429
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:45,760
What are your qualifications?

430
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:47,424
Where did you
get your training?

431
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:50,784
Ooh, well I haven't had
any training per se,

432
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:53,344
I've always been naturally
good with numbers.

433
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:55,264
Got a good instinct for them.

434
00:30:55,296 --> 00:30:57,088
Right, Teddy?

435
00:31:00,832 --> 00:31:02,496
Right.

436
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:06,368
This is all falling
into place now.

437
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:11,840
Ms. White,
I just have to ask.

438
00:31:13,376 --> 00:31:16,096
You're not managing accounts
anywhere else, are you?

439
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,176
Right now? No.

440
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:20,256
I'm a cashier at a car wash.

441
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,272
I'm not really clear about
what happened in there.

442
00:31:26,304 --> 00:31:28,704
What happened is good news.

443
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:31,104
Ignorance of the law does
not equate to criminality.

444
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:33,056
It equates to ignorance.

445
00:31:33,088 --> 00:31:36,160
Look, pay your back taxes,
pay the penalties,

446
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,432
and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.

447
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:40,672
Pay with what?

448
00:31:40,704 --> 00:31:42,816
I owe them $617,000.

449
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,576
- What am I--
- Look, just figure it out.

450
00:31:44,608 --> 00:31:47,808
All right? You just
dodged prison.

451
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,464
Sell your assets.
Get rid of the BMW,

452
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,968
take out a second
mortgage on your house.

453
00:31:52,032 --> 00:31:53,856
Take a mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.

454
00:31:53,888 --> 00:31:56,128
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets

455
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,144
- left to sell.
- Ted.

456
00:31:58,176 --> 00:32:01,376
If you don't pay them, they
will reopen the investigation.

457
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,128
And that little fiction
I just spun up there

458
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,240
will completely unravel.

459
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:08,352
You have to settle.

460
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,736
Wish I could.

461
00:33:00,192 --> 00:33:02,400
Come in.

462
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,552
I hope you brought an appetite.

463
00:33:21,952 --> 00:33:23,744
Yeah. I guess.

464
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:30,336
Mike mentioned
you have some questions.

465
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:36,960
Yeah.

466
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:40,672
We'll eat first.
And then we'll talk.

467
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:49,184
Right on.

468
00:34:00,928 --> 00:34:02,912
What am I doing here?

469
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:16,320
I know you have concerns.

470
00:34:16,352 --> 00:34:19,232
What happened yesterday

471
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,960
to my man at the farm--

472
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,624
It was a terrible thing.

473
00:34:22,656 --> 00:34:26,720
Oh, the dude getting
his head blown off? Yeah.

474
00:34:26,752 --> 00:34:30,400
I have invited you
into my home,

475
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:32,544
prepared food,

476
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,296
so we could sit and talk.

477
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:41,248
Discuss what's going on
in this business,

478
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:44,320
our business, like men.

479
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:48,064
And I will explain
everything that's happening.

480
00:34:48,096 --> 00:34:50,240
I will answer your questions.

481
00:34:50,272 --> 00:34:54,912
But first, I need you...

482
00:34:54,944 --> 00:34:58,144
to answer one question for me.

483
00:34:59,904 --> 00:35:02,080
Can you cook Walter's formula?

484
00:35:04,448 --> 00:35:06,624
What?

485
00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:08,384
Walter's formula.

486
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,944
Can you produce this product?

487
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:14,432
Without any help, alone?

488
00:35:14,464 --> 00:35:16,672
No.

489
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,448
Why?

490
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,992
You asking me if I can
cook Mr. White's crystal?

491
00:35:25,024 --> 00:35:29,888
Without him? Me?

492
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,872
The junkie loser
you were about to waste

493
00:35:31,904 --> 00:35:34,304
and dump in the desert
a month ago?

494
00:35:34,336 --> 00:35:37,184
This is your plan, huh?

495
00:35:37,216 --> 00:35:42,592
Invite me in your house,
make whatever this is,

496
00:35:42,624 --> 00:35:47,232
be my buddy and--
And make me feel

497
00:35:47,264 --> 00:35:49,312
important,

498
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:53,280
then get me to keep
cooking for you

499
00:35:53,312 --> 00:35:55,776
after you kill Mr. White.

500
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,640
You want to-- You want
to talk like men?

501
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:02,048
Let's talk like men!

502
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,272
You kill Mr. White, you're
gonna have to kill me too.

503
00:36:06,304 --> 00:36:09,504
That is not what I asked you.

504
00:36:09,536 --> 00:36:12,032
You are here

505
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:14,944
because circumstances
with the cartel are untenable.

506
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,216
And I need your help.

507
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:21,184
I need you to help prevent
an all-out war.

508
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:26,080
Now, if you would,

509
00:36:26,112 --> 00:36:28,480
answer the question.

510
00:37:29,056 --> 00:37:32,096
Hey, you, uh--
You headed out?

511
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:36,608
Yeah.

512
00:38:20,768 --> 00:38:23,040
<i>Yo, Mr. White. Hey, uh,</i>

513
00:38:23,072 --> 00:38:24,832
<i>I really got to talk to you.
I-- I don't know</i>

514
00:38:24,864 --> 00:38:26,656
<i>if you're with
your family or whatever,</i>

515
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:30,816
<i>but this is important,
so I'm hoping</i>

516
00:38:30,848 --> 00:38:33,696
<i>you could come over.</i>

517
00:38:40,832 --> 00:38:43,232
Thank God. Come on in.

518
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,384
You uh--
You want a beer?

519
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:50,592
- Or something?
- No.

520
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,480
- Should I sit down?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

521
00:38:52,512 --> 00:38:55,296
Yeah, sorry.
Go ahead.

522
00:38:55,328 --> 00:38:57,856
Okay, so, um--

523
00:38:57,888 --> 00:38:59,520
Okay. So...

524
00:38:59,552 --> 00:39:02,016
word has come
down that they--

525
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:06,048
They want me to go to Mexico.

526
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,312
There's some sort
of war brewing

527
00:39:09,344 --> 00:39:11,904
between Gus and the cartel.

528
00:39:11,936 --> 00:39:13,376
"Word has come down?"

529
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:17,376
Yeah, the cartel has been
messing with Gus's operation.

530
00:39:17,408 --> 00:39:19,424
Like jacking trucks
to like, send a message,

531
00:39:19,456 --> 00:39:21,824
and you know, yesterday,
that dude

532
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,232
we brought to the lab?

533
00:39:23,264 --> 00:39:25,824
I mean, they shot him
right in front of me.

534
00:39:25,888 --> 00:39:28,192
Just blew his head open.

535
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,880
Some sniper nailed him
from like a mile away.

536
00:39:33,216 --> 00:39:35,936
Anyway, they've been
holding them off,

537
00:39:35,968 --> 00:39:39,360
but between the cartel
taking pot shots

538
00:39:39,392 --> 00:39:41,632
and your brother-in-law
trying to throw a net

539
00:39:41,664 --> 00:39:44,160
over the whole deal, it's
like, what do you call,

540
00:39:44,192 --> 00:39:46,880
a rock and a hard place
situation.

541
00:39:46,912 --> 00:39:51,328
So Gus is gonna cave.

542
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,760
So the cartel wants half

543
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:56,320
of Gus' entire operation,
and they want

544
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,232
your formula, and he's
gonna give it to them.

545
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:01,568
Well, I-- I gotta
give it to them.

546
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,776
I mean, I'm supposed
to go to Mexico

547
00:40:03,808 --> 00:40:06,624
and teach a bunch of
cartel chemists

548
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,640
how to cook a batch of blue.

549
00:40:10,144 --> 00:40:12,288
You know, Gus doesn't
trust you, so...

550
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,552
I gotta go-- I mean,
you're the chemist, man!

551
00:40:15,584 --> 00:40:17,152
You know, not me.

552
00:40:17,184 --> 00:40:18,624
Let's say I go down

553
00:40:18,656 --> 00:40:21,824
to, you know, go over there,
go to the jungle

554
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:23,456
or-- Or whatever.

555
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:25,888
You know, and say they got,
like, actual chemists,

556
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,664
like cartel chemists,
asking me chemistry stuff

557
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,320
that I don't know how to
answer because I'm not you?

558
00:40:32,352 --> 00:40:34,080
And what if, like,
all the equipment

559
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:37,792
is uh, is in Mexican,
instead of English?

560
00:40:37,824 --> 00:40:40,128
You know? Oh!

561
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,048
I don't know.
I don't know.

562
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,184
I mean, if I mess this up,

563
00:40:45,216 --> 00:40:47,328
I am dead, you know?

564
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,472
All of us!

565
00:40:51,904 --> 00:40:55,840
So I-- Look, I--
I need your help.

566
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:57,888
Okay, maybe you could--

567
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,320
Maybe you could, like, coach me

568
00:41:00,352 --> 00:41:02,496
or something, you know?

569
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:04,895
Or you can give me some notes.

570
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:08,224
Mr. White.

571
00:41:08,256 --> 00:41:10,048
So you saw Gus?

572
00:41:11,648 --> 00:41:13,600
What? No.

573
00:41:13,632 --> 00:41:16,896
You didn't see Gus.
No.

574
00:41:16,928 --> 00:41:20,256
Then who told you all of that?

575
00:41:20,288 --> 00:41:23,296
It was passed down,
like I said.

576
00:41:23,328 --> 00:41:26,624
Passed down?

577
00:41:26,656 --> 00:41:28,288
By whom?

578
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:30,688
By, uh...
By Mike and them.

579
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,872
They did. They--

580
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,688
So "they" doesn't include Gus.

581
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,704
You haven't been with Gus.

582
00:41:36,736 --> 00:41:39,552
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.

583
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,672
Why are you...

584
00:41:40,704 --> 00:41:43,104
You weren't at Gus's house
last night.

585
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,216
What?

586
00:41:46,976 --> 00:41:48,960
What the hell?

587
00:41:48,992 --> 00:41:51,456
J-Jesus--

588
00:41:51,488 --> 00:41:52,640
It's still here.

589
00:41:54,272 --> 00:41:56,928
- It's still here.
- Oh, Jesus.

590
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,800
You look me in the eye
and you tell me

591
00:42:04,832 --> 00:42:07,456
that you weren't at
his house last night.

592
00:42:08,448 --> 00:42:11,648
I, um...

593
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,376
Look, I didn't have a chance.

594
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:15,456
All right?

595
00:42:15,488 --> 00:42:17,792
Okay, I knew you would
react this way.

596
00:42:17,824 --> 00:42:19,648
I knew you would freak out

597
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,864
and wouldn't
believe me--

598
00:42:20,896 --> 00:42:24,416
That's why I didn't
say anything.

599
00:42:24,448 --> 00:42:27,680
Look, there was just this
one big pot of stew, okay?

600
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,344
He just made this one big pot,

601
00:42:29,376 --> 00:42:31,872
and we both ate from it--
What was I supposed to do?

602
00:42:31,904 --> 00:42:32,992
Huh? Poison myself?

603
00:42:33,024 --> 00:42:35,328
Two hours and 18 minutes,

604
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,440
and you couldn't figure out
a way to give it to him.

605
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:39,680
- He never left the room!
- You lying little shit!

606
00:42:40,896 --> 00:42:42,624
You had one thing to do!

607
00:42:42,656 --> 00:42:45,504
One thing! That is
the only thing, I might add,

608
00:42:45,536 --> 00:42:47,776
that would save our lives.

609
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,592
Right there.
You were in his house!

610
00:42:50,624 --> 00:42:52,608
And you didn't have
the guts to do it.

611
00:42:57,056 --> 00:43:00,192
Two hours and 18 minutes?

612
00:43:00,256 --> 00:43:02,560
You never had any intention
of killing him, did you?

613
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,752
How did you know I was
at his house last night?

614
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,064
Were you following me?

615
00:43:11,872 --> 00:43:15,008
This.
This is how I knew.

616
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,120
You bugged my car?

617
00:43:21,152 --> 00:43:23,552
7:10 to 9:28 p.m.

618
00:43:23,584 --> 00:43:25,312
Two hours and 18 minutes,

619
00:43:25,376 --> 00:43:27,456
but you had no intentions,
did you?

620
00:43:27,488 --> 00:43:30,816
Not the slightest intention.

621
00:43:30,848 --> 00:43:32,768
Everything that
I have done for you--

622
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,064
You put a bug on my car?

623
00:43:36,096 --> 00:43:39,136
I'm sorry. After everything
you've done for me?

624
00:43:39,168 --> 00:43:41,408
What you've done for me?

625
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,488
You've killed me
is what you've done.

626
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,312
You've signed my death warrant.

627
00:43:45,344 --> 00:43:47,104
And now you want advice?

628
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:48,288
All right,
I'll give you advice.

629
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,232
Go to Mexico and screw up,
like I know you will,

630
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:53,088
and wind up
in a barrel somewhere!

631
00:44:44,064 --> 00:44:45,472
Oh, God!

632
00:45:46,144 --> 00:45:48,416
Can you walk?

633
00:45:51,104 --> 00:45:52,672
Yeah.

634
00:45:52,704 --> 00:45:56,480
You get the fuck out of here
and never come back.

635
00:46:10,912 --> 00:46:11,936
Ohh!
